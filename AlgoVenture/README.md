## Algoventure.

### Background:
We are just before Summer of 2022. It was my first year at the Biology faculty of the University of Athens. And the last one. There are many reasons I dropped out, including economic, interest, carreerish, marketish etc.   
Despite all that, remember, we are in 2022. NFT hype, crypto markets to the sky, crypto everywhere on the news etc.   
I have been interested in crypto ever since Bitcoin hit $300 per Bitcoin. That year of 2021-22, was also the year I hit 18 and was able to do adult things *huh~ own crypto*. 

Anyways long story short, I learnt about Algorand and after a few months of using the Algorand blockchain and some DAPPS, I was inspired and felt like I could also build something similar. I have always been having lots of ideas for projects anyways.

I then realized, I know nothing about Web Developing. Yeah I was always interesting in programming-algorithms and maths and also had a python phase before High School and some spikes during it, but I had never touched HTML or anything with braces during that phase because it felt wrong. (Despite eventually braces felt just so right, when I got started years later. Should have been my life experience, and seeing the world from another *perspective* :D). 

I tried some inspect elements to see what I would have to deal with and I got detered.

There were visual website builders, but to be honest they felt kind of "limited" and also I felt weird, not actually coding. I am a fighter, I will fight as hard as I can to get somewhere I want to reach. That felt way too easy? dumb? hypocritic? If others can do it, I can also do it!

Hopefully for me there was Mimo in Play Store. There is where my ***Adventure*** started. 

I am still progressing (and from what I've learnt in the past months, there is no completion point here so *hehe*.)

I am not sure how the journey will look like in a few years, as there are many side quests, I enjoy taking. I eventually believe I will have created an Algorand DAPP. Or more.

*Algoventure* (tho it's mostly weird JS XD)
