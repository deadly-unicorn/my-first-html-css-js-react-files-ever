# progressRepo (initial name)
In this repository I stored my first example-practise executions. I believe they all have a corresponding Mimo lesson, on the "Web Developing" roadmap.
Mimo is/was an application that can get you started with Web Developing (HTML,CSS,JavaScript,React,Git,DB), Python, SQL.
